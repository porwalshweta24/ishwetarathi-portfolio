                                    <p>Embarking on a long weekend getaway, we planned a three-day road trip from Pune to Hyderabad, eager for an adventure filled with exploration and discovery. Our destination? The awe-inspiring Statue of Equality, a monumental tribute to humanity's unity and diversity.
                                        </br></br>As we journeyed through the diverse landscapes of southern India, our excitement mounted with each passing mile. The anticipation of experiencing the grandeur of the Statue of Equality and the spiritual tranquility of Hyderabad filled us with eager anticipation. Along the way, we shared stories, laughter, and snacks, forging deeper bonds as we traversed the scenic route towards our destination.
                                        </br></br>Arriving in Hyderabad on the second day of our long weekend, our first stop was the Statue of Equality, nestled within the serene surroundings of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) temple complex. Standing majestically at over 216 feet tall, the statue depicted the revered saint, philosopher, and social reformer, Sri Ramanujacharya. As we marveled at its grandeur, we felt a sense of awe and reverence wash over us, reminding us of the enduring values of love and compassion that transcend all boundaries.
                                        </br></br>In addition to visiting the Statue of Equality, we had the privilege of experiencing the sacred ritual of Abhishek at the Mallikarjun Temple. This ancient practice, where devotees offer sacred substances like milk, honey, and water to the deity, was a profoundly moving experience. As we participated in the ritual, we felt a deep sense of connection to the divine and to the rich spiritual heritage of our country.
                                        </br></br>But our long weekend journey didn't end there. Before departing Hyderabad, we ventured into the sanctuary of a jungle area allowed for daytime travel. Amidst the lush greenery and vibrant wildlife, we encountered the serene beauty of nature firsthand. Along the way, we indulged in local delicacies like ram kand phal, savoring the flavors of the region. These moments of exploration and immersion in nature added a sense of adventure and wonder to our long weekend getaway, leaving us with memories to cherish for a lifetime.

                                    <p>In the sacred month of Sravan Adhik Maas in 2023, our group of close friends embarked on a special pilgrimage Gujrat jyotilings. Spanning from the 11th to the 15th of August, our journey coincided with a long weekend, providing us with ample time to immerse ourselves in spiritual experiences and create lasting memories. With great anticipation, we planned a five-day trip from Pune to explore the sacred sites of Jyotirling Somnath and Nageshwar, followed by the mystical city of Dwarika and its revered Bhet Dwarika.
                                        </br></br>Our adventure commenced with a flight from Pune to Mumbai, where we rendezvoused before continuing our travels to Rajkot by air, and then by car to the sacred city of Dwarika. En route, we eagerly anticipated the spiritual revelations that awaited us, knowing that our journey fell within the sacred time frame of Sravan month Adhik Maas, believed to amplify the blessings of religious activities.
                                        </br></br>Upon our arrival in Dwarika, we were greeted by the ancient charm and spiritual aura of the city, steeped in mythology and legend. Our first stop was the enchanting Bhet Dwarika, accessible by a scenic ferry ride across the Arabian Sea. As we approached the island, the sight of the temple complex, surrounded by azure waters, left us in awe of its divine beauty.
                                        </br></br>After paying our respects at Bhet Dwarika, we embarked on a soul-stirring journey to the revered Jyotirling Somnath Temple. Set against the backdrop of the Arabian Sea, the temple's majestic architecture and serene ambiance provided the perfect setting for moments of prayer and reflection. As we witnessed the mesmerizing evening aarti ceremony, the rhythmic chants and the flickering lamps created an atmosphere of divine grace and spiritual enlightenment.
